### How is it different from xxx?

We do more (currently 90+ features, adjustable in the config file).

Like most fix mods, we modify the code to make features work, but our invasiveness is minimal, so you can usually install it alongside other mods without issues.

### Why do most config files lack detailed descriptions?

This mod is still in a relatively early stage of development, but they are already stable!

### Can I add this mod to my ModPack...?

Yes! You can freely add this mod to your ModPack and modify it without restrictions, as long as you are not a bad actor.
